// variables are symbolic names used to store and modify values
// variable can be created with the syntax var name = some value ;
// ';' is neccesary at the end of a line because JS uses it to separate lines
// use '' around strings
// '//' can be used to create single line comments
// three primary types of variables are integers, strings, and booleans
// other variable types include undefined and null
// the value stored in a constant cannot be modified
// variables have a scope that determines where in the code they can be accessed
